This section is the most important information in this documentation. It is recommended you at least skim this page before starting and/or asking for help.
All template related objects will be located in the top-level folder, \content\template.
Top-level blueprints (i.e. BP_Player and BP_Enemy) should be used as containers – a place to combine your components. Individual behaviors have been encapsulated to components (i.e. BP_DamageableComponent). To pass information up (i.e. from a component to its container BP), use a dispatcher. Weapons inherit from BP_Weapon, which inherits from Skeletal Mesh Component. To add a weapon to the player, attach it as a child of the first person mesh. Switching between weapons is handled by the BP_WeaponManagerComponent. To make your own weapons, you should make a COPY OF BP_GenericWeapon. Copying it will preserve all the code inside, which you can use as a template. All weapons are given lifetime events and relevant dispatchers, which can be used for setup or for listening for . Lifetime events for attacks are included in each BP inheriting BP_Weapon. Each attack has been given an event graph for organization. Calling lifetime events occurs semi-automatically in the template. One condition: somewhere you must call Event Attack End or you’ll get stuck in the attack! You can call the event through blueprints or use the existing animation notify, BPN_AttackEnd. Thrown weapons are unique. Any weapon that throws itself should be divided into a component (inheriting BP_Weapon and held by the player) and an artifact (inheriting AActor and spawned when thrown). By default, BP_Player and BP_Enemy implement interfaces that allow them to receive damage and knockback from certain attacks. If you add more enemies or physics actors, check if they need to implement any interfaces. Importing the Template The UE5 template for Game Feel is distributed as a .zip file.
